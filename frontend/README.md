This is to serve as a log of what has been done so far and can be used as part of our final report. I have tried to explain what has been done so far.

## Features

- Allow users to sign up/login to their own dashboard.
- Allow users to add an expense.
- Allow users to set a maximum spend per category.
- Allow users to see summary of spending and suggestions of which category they are spending the most on. (Popup Modal)
- Allow users to view their total spending by month in Line Chart format. (Maybe this could be interactive?).
- Allow users to view their total spending by month in Pie Chart format and Table view.
